## Phase 34 — Goal-Directed Reasoning / Planning

The repository now contains the dedicated Phase 34 implementation under `phase34_reasoning_planning/`.

Acceptance evidence:

- 3 progressively harder planning families × 3 seeds;
- 3 held-out cases;
- 3 adversarial controls;
- exact-plan replay validation;
- 8/8 regression tests;
- repeated acceptance gate with identical results.

See [PHASE34_ACCEPTANCE.md](./PHASE34_ACCEPTANCE.md).

## What Mirror 7 demonstrates at this boundary

Mirror 7 now has explicit mechanisms for:

- discovering and representing structure;
- maintaining stable state and temporal identity;
- learning observed transitions and predicting next state;
- intervention-based causal reasoning;
- action representation and consequence learning;
- closed-loop action/observation/update;
- bounded working memory;
- episodic experience storage and correction;
- semantic world-model construction;
- compositional abstraction;
- hierarchical planning;
- tool execution;
- language-to-structure grounding;
- counterfactual simulation;
- continual knowledge updates;
- meta-reasoning and epistemic bookkeeping;
- computation/branching efficiency mechanisms;
- robustness testing;
- transfer to unseen environments;
- full-system integration;
- explicit evidence/assumption ledgers and contradiction checks.

## What remains

Passing these phases is not equivalent to AGI.

The major research gaps are:

1. broad, independent, unseen-environment evaluation;
2. scalable world modeling beyond hand-structured benchmark environments;
3. general concept acquisition from raw, mixed-modality observations;
4. reliable long-horizon autonomy;
5. stronger compositional and abstract reasoning;
6. continual learning at realistic scale without knowledge corruption;
7. externally grounded language and tool use;
8. rigorous compute-efficiency measurements on real workloads;
9. safety, reliability, and failure containment;
10. independent reproduction by another implementation/team.

## Next research boundary

Phase 34's repository source-artifact gap is now closed. Phases 35–54 remain the current verified capability and generalization boundary.

There is no formal Phase 55 acceptance specification in the repository yet. The next boundary should be chosen from the unresolved scientific gaps rather than adding another capability row by default.

## Phase 53 — Independent Generalization Gate

```text
Phase 52  OPEN-ENDED LEARNING / RUNTIME   [IMPLEMENTED]
                     |
                     v
Phase 53  BLIND GENERALIZATION TEST        [BENCHMARK PASS]
                     |
                     v
       independent unseen-task evidence
                     |
                     v
          broader real-world testing
```

Phase 53 is complete as a project-internal blind benchmark. The learner solves 21/21 episodes with 12/12 held-out and 0 invalid actions. Third-party independent reproduction remains open.

## Phase 54 — Independent-Style Evaluation

```text
Phase 52  OPEN-ENDED LEARNING         [BENCHMARKED]
Phase 53  INTERNAL BLIND TEST          [21/21]
Phase 54  FRESH INDEPENDENT-STYLE TEST [18/18]
              |
              v
       CONTINUE NEXT PHASE
```

The engineering target of robustness across mixed action semantics and elimination of repeated invalid exploration was successfully met.
